## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://fairtrail.org/install.sh | bash
```

If you have [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed, the setup script detects it automatically. Otherwise, it asks you to paste an API key.

Once it finishes:

1. Open [localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003)
2. Or run `fairtrail search "NYC to Tokyo in July under $800"`
3. Fairtrail starts tracking prices immediately

## Why Fairtrail?

Airlines change flight prices hundreds of times a day. They use dynamic pricing to maximize what you pay. **No one shows you the price trend because the companies with the data profit from hiding it.**

<details>
<summary>The longer version</summary>

1. **Aggregators want you inside their app.** Google Flights and Hopper track price history internally but lock it behind your account.
2. **"Buy or Wait" is more profitable than transparency.** A black-box prediction keeps you dependent on their platform.
3. **Airlines don't want price transparency.** If you can see that a route dips 3 weeks before departure, that undermines dynamic pricing.

Fairtrail exists because the data is useful to *you* -- just not to the companies that have it.
</details>

### What you get

- **Natural language search** -- `"NYC to Paris around June 15 +/- 3 days"`
- **Price evolution charts** -- see how fares move over days and weeks
- **Shareable links** -- send `/q/abc123` to anyone, no login required
- **Direct booking links** -- click any data point to go straight to the airline
- **Airline comparison** -- see which carriers are cheapening vs. getting expensive
- **VPN price comparison** -- test the myth: do prices change when you browse from different countries?
- **Self-hosted** -- your searches stay private, your data stays on your machine
- **Agent-friendly API** -- hook Claude Code, Codex, or any agent into your instance

## VPN Price Comparison

Test the myth that VPN location affects flight prices. Fairtrail can scrape the same query from multiple countries and show the results side by side.

### How it works

1. An [ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com) sidecar container runs alongside Fairtrail
2. For each scrape run, Fairtrail routes Playwright through the VPN's SOCKS5 proxy
3. All browser signals align to the target country (IP, locale, timezone, Accept-Language, geolocation)
4. Your local (no VPN) price is always captured as a baseline
5. The chart shows a per-country comparison view

### Setup

1. Go to **Settings** and paste your [ExpressVPN activation code](https://www.expressvpn.com/setup) (encrypted before storage)
2. Start Fairtrail with VPN support:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.vpn.yml up -d
   ```
3. When creating a new tracker, toggle **"Compare prices from different countries"** and pick which countries to compare
4. Each scrape run: local baseline first, then each VPN country sequentially
5. On the chart page, use the **view filter** to switch between:
   - All countries (full detail)
   - Country comparison (cheapest price per country over time)
   - Local only / individual country isolation

<details>
<summary>docker-compose.vpn.yml details</summary>

The VPN sidecar uses [`misioslav/expressvpn`](https://hub.docker.com/r/misioslav/expressvpn) and exposes:
- SOCKS5 proxy on port 1080 (internal, used by Playwright)
- REST API on port 8000 (internal, used by Fairtrail to switch countries)

Requirements:
- `EXPRESSVPN_CODE` in `~/.fairtrail/.env`
- Docker host must have `/dev/net/tun` (kernel TUN module)
- The sidecar needs `NET_ADMIN` capability

Only Playwright traffic goes through the VPN. Database, Redis, and web UI traffic stay on normal Docker networking.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Supported countries</summary>

US, GB, DE, FR, ES, IT, NL, IE, JP, KR, IN, AU, CA, MX, BR, AR, CO, TH, SG, HK

Each country profile aligns: locale, timezone, Accept-Language header, and geolocation to match the VPN exit point. Currency stays user-controlled (independent from VPN country).
</details>

## Requirements

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- One of:
  - [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (free with Claude Pro/Max)
  - [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) (free with ChatGPT Pro)
  - An API key from Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google
  - [Ollama](https://ollama.com), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp), or [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai)

<details>
<summary>LLM Providers</summary>

Fairtrail needs an LLM for two things: parsing natural language queries and extracting price data from Google Flights pages.

| Provider | Auth | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | Auto-detected (host `~/.claude`) | Free (Pro/Max plan) | Subscription CLI |
| **Codex CLI** | Auto-detected (host `~/.codex`) | Free (ChatGPT Pro) | Subscription CLI |
| **Anthropic** | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Pay-per-token | Claude Haiku 4.5 (default) |
| **OpenAI** | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Pay-per-token | GPT-4.1 Mini |
| **Google** | `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` | Pay-per-token | Gemini 2.5 Flash |
| **Ollama** | None (local) | Free | Select in admin UI |
| **llama.cpp** | None (local) | Free | Select in admin UI |
| **vLLM** | None (local) | Free | GPU-accelerated (port 8000) |
| **OpenAI + custom URL** | `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | Varies | OpenRouter or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

**Three ways to use Fairtrail:**

- **Subscription users** (Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT Pro) -- auto-detected, auth tokens mounted read-only.
- **API key users** -- paste a key, passed via env var, never written to disk.
- **Local model users** -- select Ollama/llama.cpp/vLLM in the admin UI, type your model ID.
</details>

## How It Works

```
You type: "SFO to Tokyo sometime in July +/- 5 days"

              +------------------+
```

The built-in cron runs on a configurable interval (default: every 3h). Each run captures prices across all active queries and the chart pages update automatically.

## Managing Fairtrail

```
Usage: fairtrail [command]

Commands:
  (none)       Start Fairtrail (Ctrl+C to stop)
  search ".."  Search and track a flight from the terminal
  start        Start in background
  stop         Stop -- pauses all price tracking until you start again
  logs         View live logs
  status       Check if running
  update       Pull latest version and restart
  version      Show version and commit
  uninstall    Remove Fairtrail and all data
  help         Show this help
```

<details>
<summary>Headless CLI</summary>

Run Fairtrail entirely in the terminal:

```bash
fairtrail --headless                              # Interactive search wizard
fairtrail --headless --backend claude-code        # Use Claude Code as AI backend
fairtrail --headless --backend codex              # Use Codex as AI backend
fairtrail --headless --list                       # Show all tracked queries
fairtrail --headless --view <id>                  # Live price chart (auto-refreshes every 30s)
fairtrail --headless --view <id> --tmux           # Split grouped routes into tmux panes
```

Without `--headless`, `--view` opens the chart in your browser and `--list` opens the admin dashboard.

**Features:**
- Natural language search, same as the web
- Braille chart with per-airline colored trend lines
- Live refresh with countdown bar
- Multi-destination ("Frankfurt to Bogota or Medellin")
- tmux integration for grouped routes
- Backend selection: `--backend claude-code|codex|anthropic|openai|google|ollama|llamacpp|vllm`

<details>
<summary>Configuration</summary>

All settings are in `~/.fairtrail/.env` (generated by the installer):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | -- | Anthropic API key |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | -- | OpenAI API key |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | -- | Custom endpoint (vLLM, OpenRouter) |
| `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` | -- | Google AI API key |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama server address |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `postgres` | Database password |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Auto-generated | Admin panel password |
| `CRON_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable built-in scrape scheduler |
| `CRON_INTERVAL_HOURS` | `3` | Hours between scrape runs |
| `HOST_PORT` | `3003` | Host port for Fairtrail |
| `EXPRESSVPN_CODE` | -- | ExpressVPN activation code (for VPN comparison) |
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why self-host instead of using fairtrail.org?</summary>

- **It can't work any other way.** A centralized service scraping Google Flights gets IP-banned within days. Thousands of self-hosted instances, each making a few quiet requests from different IPs, is the only architecture that survives.
- **Your searches stay private.** No one sees what routes you're watching.
- **You control the scrape frequency.** Default is every 3 hours. Want every hour? Change one setting.
- **Free with Claude Code, Codex, or a local model.**
- **Your data, your database.** Price history lives in your own Postgres.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Community Data</summary>

Fairtrail is fully decentralized. You run everything on your own machine.

**fairtrail.org** aggregates anonymized price data that self-hosted instances **opt in** to share.

**What gets shared (opt-in only):** route, travel date, price, currency, airline, stops, cabin class, scrape timestamp.

**What is never shared:** your queries, search history, preferences, API keys, IP address, or identity.

Enable in Settings or during setup. Explore community data at [fairtrail.org/explore](https://fairtrail.org/explore).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Agent & CLI Integration</summary>

Your local instance exposes a REST API. See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the full reference.

```bash
# Parse a natural language query
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/parse \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "NYC to Paris around June 15 +/- 3 days"}' | jq .

# Create a tracked query
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/queries \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ ... }' | jq .

# Trigger an immediate scrape
curl -s http://localhost:3003/api/cron/scrape \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" | jq .

# Get price data
curl -s http://localhost:3003/api/queries/{id}/prices | jq .
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Settings</summary>

Access at `/admin` (no login required on self-hosted instances):

- **Manage queries** -- pause, resume, delete, adjust scrape frequency
- **Configure LLM** -- choose extraction provider and model
- **Monitor costs** -- see LLM API usage per scrape run
- **View fetch history** -- success/failure status, errors, snapshot counts
- **VPN setup** -- paste ExpressVPN activation code, configure default countries
</details>

## Development

```bash
npm install
docker compose up -d db redis

<summary>Why Playwright + LLM Instead of Google's Internal API?</summary>

Google Flights has an undocumented internal API that returns structured JSON without a browser. The [`fli`](https://github.com/punitarani/fli) project reverse-engineers it. We investigated and decided against it.

**What the direct API gives you:** sub-second searches, no browser, no LLM cost.

**What it costs you:**

|  | Fairtrail | [fli](https://github.com/punitarani/fli) |
|---|---|---|
| Approach | Playwright + LLM extraction | Reverse-engineered internal API |
| Speed | 3-10s per search | Sub-second |
| Booking links | Yes | No |
| Currency control | Yes (`&curr=`, `&gl=` params) | No |
| Fare class / cabin | Yes | No |
| Seats remaining | Yes | No |
| VPN comparison | Yes (Docker sidecar) | No |
| Price tracking | Built-in (cron + Postgres) | Manual |
| Shareable charts | Yes (`/q/[id]`) | No |

Both approaches share the same risk: Google can break either one at any time. We'd rather depend on the stable, public-facing UI than on undocumented internal array positions.

**Use Fairtrail if** you want to track prices over time, see trends, get booking links, and share charts.

**Use [fli](https://github.com/punitarani/fli) if** you want instant programmatic lookups from scripts.
